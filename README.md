## Description

Classic Arcade Game. The Player is to reach the water on the other side of their initial position on the grass, avoiding collision with Enemies.

Enemies run across the board on random speeds. Upon collision with one, Player is returned to initial point, starting again.

Player wins when they reach the water and their avatar is "upgraded" to a new image, then the game starts again.

## Instructions

Please download the complete game including index.html file and folders css, images and js.

To start the game, double-click index.html.

You are the Player. Your goal is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the Enemies (bugs).

Use left, right, up and down keys to move. The Enemies move across the paved block portion of the game board.

If you collide with an Enemy, you are moved back to the starting point on the grass.

You win the game when you reach the water (i.e., the top of the game board). Your avatar is then "upgraded", and the game starts again.

When you get the "top" avatar (with the crown), you know that you are doing great! You then go back to the initial avatar and start all over again from scratch.

Good luck!
